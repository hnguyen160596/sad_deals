# Google Business Profile Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and optimize your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) to improve your local SEO and visibility in Google Search and Maps.

## What is Google Business Profile?

Google Business Profile is a free tool that allows businesses to manage their online presence across Google, including Search and Maps. When someone searches for your business or related products and services, your Business Profile can display your hours, website, phone number, photos, reviews, and more.

## Benefits of Having a Google Business Profile

- Appear in local search results and Google Maps
- Display key business information to potential customers
- Collect and respond to customer reviews
- Share updates, offers, and events
- Get insights on how customers find and interact with your business
- Improve local SEO rankings

## Prerequisites

- A Google account
- A physical business location or service area
- A phone number and website for your business

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Create or Claim Your Business Profile

1. Go to [Google Business Profile](https://business.google.com/)
2. Click "Manage now" or "Sign in"
3. Enter your business name
4. If your business already exists, you'll need to claim it by verifying ownership
5. If your business doesn't exist, you'll need to create a new listing

### Step 2: Complete Your Business Information

Fill in all the following details about your business:

- **Business name**: Use your exact business name

- Cover photo (landscape format)
- Business interior photos
- Business exterior photos

### Step 4: Verify Your Business

Google needs to verify that your business is legitimate. Verification options include:

- **Postcard**: Google sends a postcard with a verification code to your business address
- **Phone**: Google calls or texts a verification code to your business phone
- **Email**: Google sends a verification code to your business email
- **Google Search Console**: If you've already verified your domain in Search Console
- **Instant verification**: Available for some businesses

### Step 5: Optimize Your Profile

After verification, enhance your profile with:

- **Products/Services**: Add detailed information about what you offer
- **Attributes**: Select applicable attributes for your business (e.g., "free Wi-Fi," "wheelchair accessible")
- **Q&A**: Set up frequently asked questions and answers
- **Messaging**: Enable customers to message you directly through Google
- **Booking button**: Add a booking or appointment link if applicable

## Local SEO Implementation

### 1. Implement Local Business Schema

Add LocalBusiness schema.org markup to your website:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Your Business Name",
  "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "telephone": "+15551234567",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 Main St",
    "addressLocality": "City",
    "addressRegion": "State",
    "postalCode": "12345",
    "addressCountry": "US"
  },
  "geo": {
    "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
    "latitude": 40.7128,
    "longitude": -74.0060
  },
  "openingHoursSpecification": [
    {
      "@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification",
      "dayOfWeek": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"],
      "opens": "09:00",
      "closes": "17:00"
    },
    {
      "@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification",
      "dayOfWeek": ["Saturday"],
      "opens": "10:00",
      "closes": "16:00"
    }
  ],
  "priceRange": "$$"
}
```

### 2. Add Location Pages to Your Website

If you have multiple locations, create individual pages for each one with:

- Location-specific content
- Address and contact information
- Operating hours
- Google Maps embed
- Directions

### 4. Build Local Citations

Ensure your business information is consistent across these platforms:
